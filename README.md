My script "FloodAffectedPrivateParcels.py" is to be run from the QGIS Processing Toolbox.

I have provided two datasets for testing, containing 8 shape files each for Hobsons Bay and Frankston.

The script requires "Invalid features filtering" to be turned off to run (Settings->Options->Processing).

The script also requires atleast one layer in the layers panel when it runs, so it is best to just drag the shape files for a council into QGIS on startup (this also speeds up selecting the 8 input layers in the GUI).

I have discussed these "issues" further in my write-up!

Cheers,
Paul
