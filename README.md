My script "FloodAffectedPrivateParcels.py" is to be run from the QGIS Processing Toolbox.

I have provided two datasets for testing, containing 8 shape files each for Hobsons Bay and Frankston.

The script requires "Invalid features filtering" (Settings->Options->Processing) to be turned off to run.

The script also requires atleast one layer in the layers panel when it runs, so it is best to just drag all the shape files into QGIS on startup (this also speeds up selecting the 8 input layers for each council).

I have discussed these "issues" further in my write-up!

Cheers,
Paul
